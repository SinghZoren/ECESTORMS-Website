# Font Installation Instructions

To complete the font setup for the ECESTORMS website, please follow these steps:

1. Download the TT Octosquares Trial Bold Italic font from [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/tt-octosquares.font)
2. Extract the downloaded zip file
3. Rename the file `TT Octosquares Trial Bold Italic.ttf` to `TT-Octosquares-Trial-Bold-Italic.ttf`
4. Place the renamed font file in this directory (`public/fonts/`)

The website is configured to use this font for the main heading on the home page. Once you've added the font file, the styling will be applied correctly.

Note: This font is for personal use only. If you plan to use it in a commercial project, please purchase the appropriate license from TypeType Foundry.
